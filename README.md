# Todo app

![Design preview for the Todo app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Overview

## My process

### Built with

 - Flexbox
 - SCSS
 - Javascript
 - Semantic HTML5 markup
 - LocalStorage
 - Sortable.js
 - JS Animations

### Features

- Todos and theme are stored in Local Storage.
- Drag and drop to reorder items using library Sortable.js. Reordered items are also stored in Local Storage.
- When the list is empty, or there is nothing to display in the "Completed" tab, I was missing the information that there was nothing to display. I added it.
- I created a toast notification pop up in various events. (Adding todo / incorrectly entered input / Removing todo / clearing all.)
